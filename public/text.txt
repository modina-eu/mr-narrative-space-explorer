Still Moving invites you into a space where instinctive physicality meets linguistic thinking, using mixed reality (MR). The project, part of the larger Held in Human series, explores the meaning of presence and “being in a body” in a contemporary world where technology significantly extends and mediates human experience. Equipped with a see-through VR headset that allows for both physical and digital navigation, the performer—who may be you, the audience—enters a dynamic “thought space.” We invite up to three performers at a time to lend their bodies to the dramaturgy. Each participant brings their own unique physicality, imagination, and interpretation, contributing to an evolving choreographic language and inclusive dramaturgy.
