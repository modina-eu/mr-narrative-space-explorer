A Portable mixed reality (MR) environment to explore text and physicality in a digital space. This web app is inspired by the system used in the interactive performance, Still Moving (developed by [Norbert Pape](https://norbertpape.github.io/index.html)), originally implemented in Unity3D with the Meta Quest Headset. This demo intends to offer a lo-fi emulation designed to explore some of the conceptual foundations of the original system.
To begin, enable the camera view in your mobile browser, tap the screen to spawn a new word, drag with two fingers to rotate or resize the last word. Words are selected from the text corpus, which can be edited in the menu. The default text is taken from the Still Moving project description.
